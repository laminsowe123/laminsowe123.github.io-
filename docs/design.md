## User Interface design

The user interface design is a crucial aspect of the public toilet finder system, as it directly impacts the user experience and usability of the platform. The following is a proposed design for the user interface:

1. Search Bar - The search bar is the primary means of finding public toilets. Users can enter a location or address to search for nearby public toilets.
2. Map View - The map view displays the search results as markers on a map. Users can click on a marker to view more information about a public toilet, such as its address, opening hours, and accessibility features.
3. List View - The list view displays the search results as a list, with each item showing the name, address, and distance from the user's current location.

The user interface design should be intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing. It should also be responsive, meaning that it adapts to different screen sizes and devices. The color scheme and typography should be consistent throughout the platform, and the layout should be clear and easy to navigate.

Note: The user interface design is a proposed design and may be subject to change based on user feedback, technical constraints, and other factors. The design should be validated through user testing and iterative design processes to ensure that it meets the needs and expectations of the target audience.
