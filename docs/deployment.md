# Deployment

## Release Notes
Public Toilet finder, version 1.0. For this website, we used a range of system dependencies. For the map service, we used Mapbox for free and precise mapping . We used HTML, CSS and JavaScript on Visual studio code for the frontend work. Bristol Open data played a huge part in providing us with the data set and public toilet locations  to incorporate into our website.
